# TriviaGame

Front end:
A windows program, using WPF and C#.
Interfaces with the backend server to display question and lets user choose an answer.

Back end (C++):
Uses SQL to store user scores and get questions to send to the front end.

Was a two man school project,
assigned to teach us working with servers, SQL, GUI and more.

Source code for front-end on client/client (.cs files),
for the back-end, checkout client/server (.cpp andd .h files).
